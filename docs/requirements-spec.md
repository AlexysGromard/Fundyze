# Requirements Specification â€“ Fundyze project

---

## 1. Project Objective

Develop a modern web application capable of **automatically monitoring** new companies going public (IPO) or raising funds, as well as **emerging crypto projects** with high potential or upcoming airdrops.

The application will integrate an **AI-based analysis system** (via a Large Language Model) to **summarize and evaluate** each project in a concise and insightful way.

All data will be **presented clearly and structurally** to the user, helping **investment decision-making**.
